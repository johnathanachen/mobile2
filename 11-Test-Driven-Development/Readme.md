# Test Driven Development

## Vocabulary

- TDD
- Integrated testing
- Continous integration
- Performance testing

## Objectives

- Write tests for your API
- Understand the benefits of writing tests


## TDD

TDD is an approach to software development where we start writing tests first before writing any application code.

## Why do we write tests?

We write tests to ensure that a part of our software is behaving the way we expect it to 99% of the time.

Writing good tests are hard, but with good architectural design, testing can be made simple.
Writing code to be composable, perform a single responsibility can enable us to write testable code.

## What should we test for?


## Types of tests
Different types of tests achieve different results. Depending on your project/language/preference you might choose to do one of the other, or use a combination of them.

There are many types of testing but we will go over the top 3
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Stress Testing
- Performance Testing
- Usability Testing
- Beta Testing

### Integration test

Integration testing tests combined functionality after integration.


### Unit test

Unit testing tests individual components or group of related components. It is often done to test that the unit he/she has implemented is producing expected output against given input.


## Testing our flask API

1. Come up with a resource/task and have students think of possible test cases. Have them vote on good ones and bad ones


## Challenges
1. Write 5 tests for our user/trip resource & route. 
Examples of things you can test:
- Constraints
